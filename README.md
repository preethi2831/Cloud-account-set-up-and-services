## Ex.1 Cloud Account Setup and Services Overview in Microsoft Azure

## Aim:

To create a cloud account in Microsoft Azure and to explore its services such as Compute, IoT,
and Security.

## Procedure:

Step 1: Go to the Azure Website
● Visit https://azure.microsoft.com
● Click on “Start free” or “Free account” in the top right corner.

Step 2: Sign Up with Microsoft Account
● If you already have a Microsoft account (Outlook/Hotmail), sign in.
● Otherwise, create a new Microsoft account using your email

Step 3: Enter Account Information
● Provide your basic details such as name, country/region, phone number, and verification
details.

Step 4: Identity Verification
● Enter your mobile number and verify using OTP (SMS or call).

Step 5: Select Support Plan
● Choose the Basic Support Plan (Free) for beginners.

Step 6:Complete Sign-Up
● Review details and click Sign Up.
● You’ll receive a confirmation email and your Azure account will be activated.

Step 7: Sign In to Azure Portal
● Go to https://portal.azure.com
● Sign in with your Microsoft account.
● This is the main dashboard where you can explore all Azure services.

## Create a User with Administrative Access (Azure Active Directory):

Secure your Azure account root user
● Sign in to the Azure Portal as the account owner.
● Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for your account.
Create a new administrative user
● Go to Azure Active Directory (AAD) → Users → New User.
● Assign a username and set a temporary password.
● Under Roles, assign Global Administrator or Owner role.
Sign in as the administrative user
● Use the newly created credentials to sign in.
● Change the password on first login.
● Now use this admin account for everyday tasks (instead of root).

## Services Overview in Azure:

Azure provides 200+ cloud services. In this experiment, we focus on the following key categories:
1. Compute Services:
 In cloud computing, compute services provide the processing power
required to run applications, execute workloads, and manage tasks.Think of it as the
“brain” or CPU power of the cloud, where virtual or physical servers are used to run
code, applications, and workloads on demand.
These services allow businesses or developers to avoid buying physical servers and instead use
cloud-based resources that can scale up or down as needed.
Types of Compute Services:
● Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – Virtual Machines (VMs)
● Platform as a Service (PaaS) – App Hosting
● Serverless Computing (Function as a Service – FaaS)
● Container-based Compute
● High Performance Computing (HPC)

2. Storage Services:
 Storage services in cloud computing provide a way to save, manage, and retrieve
 digital data over the internet instead of using local physical devices like hard drives.
It ensures:
● Scalability → Data can grow as needed.
● Accessibility → Access from anywhere, anytime.
● Durability → Data remains safe (with multiple copies across regions).
● Cost-effectiveness → Pay for what you use.
Types of Storage Services:
● Block Storage
● Object Storage
● File Storage
● Archive Storage (Cold Storage)
● Hybrid / Multi-Cloud Storage
● Database Storage (Specialized)
 
3. Networking Services:
Cloud networking refers to connecting cloud resources, applications, and services
so they can communicate securely and efficiently.
It allows:
● Access to cloud services over the internet or private links.
● Secure communication between cloud servers, databases, and applications.
● Integration with on-premises networks (hybrid cloud).
● Networking in cloud ensures data moves safely and quickly between users, apps, and
cloud infrastructure.

## Key Features of Cloud Networking:
● Scalability → Expand network resources as workload grows.
● Security → Firewalls, VPNs, encryption to protect traffic.
● Global Reach → Connect users from anywhere.
● Load Balancing → Distribute traffic for better performance.
● Flexibility → Choose between public, private, or hybrid models.

## Types of Networking Services:
● Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
● Public Cloud Networking
● Private Cloud Networking
● Multi-Cloud Networking
● Content Delivery Network (CDN)
● Cloud VPN (Virtual Private Network)

## Result
Thus, a cloud account was successfully created in Microsoft Azure, and various services such
as Compute, IoT, and Security were explored.
